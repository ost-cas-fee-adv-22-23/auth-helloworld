# CAS FEE ADV nextAuth: Team Hello World

This is a repository for the CAS FEE ADV application part at [Ostschweizer Fachhochschule](https://www.ost.ch/de/weiterbildung/weiterbildungsangebot/informatik/software-engineering-testing/cas-frontend-engineering-advanced).
The goal of this project was to set up an instance of Zitadel and get to know nextAuth.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser. There you have the possibility to authenticate yourself via our Zitadel instance. The application contains only the login and logout functions.

## Zitadel

The required secrets and variables can be viewed in the .env file. (Of course, we would not commit this file in a project that is not only used for learning purposes.)
